        <h1>Priya acts in a play</h1>
        <h6>An Enemy of the People Act 3</h6>
        <h6>Henrik Ibsen</h6>

         <h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6>
           <p>Well, I must say!</p>

        <h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
           <p4 class = "direction"> _[still writing.]_</p4>
           <p>Have you read it through</p>

        <h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6>
            <p4 class = "direction">_[laying the MS. on the desk.]_</p4>
             <p>Yes, indeed I have.</p>

        <h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
            <p>Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?</p>

        <h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6>
           <p>Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like—how
             shall I put it?—like the blow of a sledgehammer.</p>

        <h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
            <p>Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
            first blow.</p>

        <h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6>
            <p>That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
            blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
            there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.</P>

        <h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
            <p>Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
                whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
                project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
                the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
                in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
                in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—</p>
        <h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6>
            <p>Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
                penny—</p>

        <h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
            <p>Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
                be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
                enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
                another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
                the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
                the Liberals.</p>

        <h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6>
            <p>That is perfectly true! I see it coming—I see it coming; we
                are on the threshold of a revolution!</p>

        <h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
            <p>Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?</p>

        <h6 class = "Billing">Billing.</h6>
            <p>Upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you
                have pulled all the old rubbish down.</p>

        <h6 class = "Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6>
            <p>It is so clear and intelligible. One need have no special
                knowledge to understand the bearing of it. You will have every
                enlightened man on your side.</p>
