        <p> Billing.<br>
            Well, I must say!</p>

        <p>Hovstad<br>
            (still writing). Have you read it through?</p>

        <p>Billing<br>
            (laying the MS. on the desk). Yes, indeed I have.</p>

        <p>Hovstad.<br>
            Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?</p>

        <p>Billing.<br>
            Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like—how
             shall I put it?—like the blow of a sledgehammer.</p>

        <p>Hovstad.<br>
            Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the
            first blow.</p>

        <P>Billing.<br>
            That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon
            blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in
            there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.</P>
